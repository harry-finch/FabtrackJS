## Background

Initially I wrote the project in PHP/MySQL for the fablab at [Sorbonne University](https://fablab.sorbonne-universite.fr) but a lot of the features were very specific to that fablab's organization. I thought that the core functionalities however could easily apply to any fablabs and decided to make a new open source version.

I decided to develop it in NodeJS/Express because I needed to start from scratch to make it more modular, with cleaner code and comments. And because I find Javascript more pleasant to work with.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and numerous [npm](https://npmjs.com) libraries, so go check them out if you don't have them locally installed. You'll also need access to a [MySQL](http://mysql.org) server.

Clone this repository on your server.

```sh
$ git clone
```

Go to the root of the folder and run the installer. You'll be prompted for your configuration,

```sh
$ node install.js
```

Install Prisma

```sh
$ git clone
```

Create the MySQL database with Prisma.

## Usage

This is only a documentation package. You can print out [spec.md](spec.md) to your console:

```sh
$ standard-readme-spec
# Prints out the standard-readme spec
```

### Generator

To use the generator, look at [generator-standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme). There is a global executable to run the generator in that package, aliased as `standard-readme`.
